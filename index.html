        <h2>Saying farewell to MemorAI</h2>
        <p>
            When I launched MemorAI over Winter Break in 2022, my mission was to change the way
            we as students learn. It was designed as a more modern alternative to Quizlet, which 
            lacked features and was pushing its subscription too aggressively.
            The advent of AI and large language models like ChatGPT proved that there was a hunger 
            for generative AI solutions, and learning was no exception. I 
            spent countless hours working on this project, from stressing over the placement of
            each pixel for the design to changing the optimizer's learning rate for the third time in 
            a row. In the end, it transformed from a project to a platform, with profiles and sets, which 
            featured questions generated by a custom LLM and learning assisted by spaced repetition.
            All this paid off, seeing the ~170 students from Irvington and ~140 others from across
            the world come together to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had and still have many ideas that would work inside MemorAI to better help students. However,
            the costs of the service are simply too much for the free credit given, and so we have to say goodbye.
        </p>
        <p>
            MemorAI was shut down on May 11, 2023.
